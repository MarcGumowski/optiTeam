optiTeam
============

**optiTeam** implements a small tool to obtain the optimal team at hockeymanager (HM), a swiss hockey fantasy league game. You can find the game here: http://hockeymanager.ch/.

The constraints of the optimization problem are as follows: given a certain budget, the optimal team should maximize the sum of the points of 2 goalies, 8 defense players, 12 offense players, with a maximum number of 4 foreign players.

Please be aware that this tool does not take into account the blocks composition. It also only gives the team that would have gotten the maximum points until now, it is not a predictive tool of the players' performance.
